# PROJECT TTILE: Automatidata, featuring a fictional data consulting firm
****************************************************************************************

###### _Note: This project was created under the Advanced Data Analytics certification offered by Google. Please make sure this project on github is to build the portfolio and showcase the skills gained through the course._ 

## Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

###### _Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior._
